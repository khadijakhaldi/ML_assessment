# Project Steps

In this notebook we have shown: 

  1. Downloading and extracting dataset.
  
  2. Calculating the mean and std for normalization.
  
  3. Defining a ResNet model and loading a pre-trained model.

  4. Fine-tuning a pre-trained model to achieve 100% in test accuracy.
  
  5. Viewing our model's mistakes.
  
  6. Visualizing our data in lower dimensions with PCA and t-SNE.
  
  7. Viewing the learned weights of our model.
